# Domain expiring insight in the modern EAC 

Microsoft 365 customers can add their domain in system that is called Accepted domain. Once the Accepted domain is configured correctly, users in this domain can send and receive email. To keep a healthy mail flow, domain owned by customers should be active. Once domains expire, users configured under that domain will no longer receive emails. 

As these domains are owned by customers, Microsoft can't manage these domains for customers. It's customer responsibility to monitor when a domain needs renewal. 

Usually, customers lose track of their domain expiry date and donâ€™t renew it on time. This results in mail flow issue for their users. As a result, customers create support ticket to troubleshoot mail flow issue and then realize the issue is because of their domain getting expired. 

Build a notification feature that monitors the accepted domains per tenant and sends email notification to tenant admin when any of the accepted domains is approaching expiry. Email warnings will be sent one a month starting three months before domain expire. Weekly during the last month. 

The notification scripts run daily in the background. At any given point if it detects any domains that are expiring with in 90 days, 60 days, or 30 days and less, it will trigger an alert. A single alert could have multiple domains, for example, it may have one domain that is expiring in 90 days and another one that is expiring in 60, and so forth.
