# Configuring an alert policy


An alert policy is the mechanism by which you can track the following events in your organization:

- User and admin activities
- Malware threats
- Data loss incidents

After you have identified the activity on which you want to receive alerts, you can create and customize the alert in the new Exchange Admin Center (EAC). This task includes: 
- Making the alert to trigger at a specified time
- Setting the recipients who have to receive the alerts

## Create and customize alert policy

**Create and customize an alert policy:**

1. Launch the URL https://admin.exchange.microsoft.com.
2. In the left pane, navigate to **Mail flow > Alert policies**, and click **New alert policy**. 
3. Provide a name for your policy in the **Name** box and click **Next**.

> [!NOTE]
> Entering a description for the policy in the **Description** box is optional.

4. From the **Severity** drop-down list, select the severity level.
5. From the **Trigger an alert when the following insight is generated** drop-down list, select the insight type.
6. Click **Next**.
7. Provide the name or email address of the alert notification recipients in the **Email recipients** box.
8. From the **Daily notification limit** drop-down list, select daily-notification count.

> [!NOTE]

    The alert policy is created.
