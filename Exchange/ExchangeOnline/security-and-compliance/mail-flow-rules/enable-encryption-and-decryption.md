# Enable message encryption and decryption

Microsoft 365 and Office 365 Message Encryption lets email users send encrypted messages to people inside or outside their organization. For information, see [Set up new Message Encryption capabilities](/microsoft-365/compliance/set-up-new-message-encryption-capabilities). To learn how to create mail flow rules (also known as transport rules) for encryption, see [Define rules to encrypt email messages](/microsoft-365/compliance/define-mail-flow-rules-to-encrypt-email).
