### Tabs

The tabs are your second level of navigation. Each of the feature areas contains various tabs, each representing a complete feature.

### Toolbar

When you click most tabs, you'll see a toolbar. The toolbar has icons that perform a specific action.

### List view

When you select a tab, in most cases you'll see a list view. The list view in the new Exchange admin center is designed to remove limitations that existed in the Classic Exchange admin center and Exchange Control Panel.
